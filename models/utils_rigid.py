    """
    Torch differentiable implementation of the weighted Kabsch algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabsch_algorithm). Based on the correspondences and weights calculates
    the optimal rotation matrix in the sense of the Frobenius norm (RMSD), based on the estimated rotation matrix it then estimates the translation vector hence solving
    the Procrustes problem. This implementation supports batch inputs.
    Args:
        x1            (torch array): points of the first point cloud [b,n,3]
        x2            (torch array): correspondences for the PC1 established in the feature space [b,n,3]
        weights       (torch array): weights denoting if the coorespondence is an inlier (~1) or an outlier (~0) [b,n]
        normalize_w   (bool)       : flag for normalizing the weights to sum to 1
        best_k        (int)        : number of correspondences with highest weights to be used (if 0 all are used)
        w_threshold   (float)      : only use weights higher than this w_threshold (if 0 all are used)
    Returns:
        rot_matrices  (torch array): estimated rotation matrices [b,3,3]
        trans_vectors (torch array): estimated translation vectors [b,3,1]
        res           (torch array): pointwise residuals (Eucledean distance) [b,n]
        valid_gradient (bool): Flag denoting if the SVD computation converged (gradient is valid)
